-- We have a student table that also stores the Course_id of a student's favorite course. Our task has two parts related to using a SELF JOIN:

--     Find pairs of students that belong to the same department.
--     Identify students who have chosen the same Course_id as their favorite. Display the St_id, St_Name, and Course_id and order it in increasing Course_id.

SELECT s1.St_id,s1.St_Name ,s1.department,s2.St_id,s2.St_Name,s2.department
FROM
    student AS s1  
LEFT JOIN
    student AS s2  
ON s1.department=s2.department
where s1.St_id <> s2.St_id;

SELECT s1.St_id,s1.St_Name ,s1.Course_id
FROM student as s1
left join student as s2
on s1.Course_id=s2.Course_id
where s1.St_id<>s2.St_id
order by s1.Course_id;
